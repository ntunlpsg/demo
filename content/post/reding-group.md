### Introduction
The Natural Language Processing (NLP) reading group meets regularly (usually weekly) to discuss research topics on a particular sub-field of NLP.

### Subscription
You can receive announcements about the reading group by joining our mailing list. To join the mailing list, please use an academic email address and send an email to ntunlpsg@gmail.com with a subject "subscribe ntu-nlp". If you use a non-academic email address, we would have to verify it which could delay your subscription process.

### Location 
***NTU MICL*** Lab (former MML Lab) meeting room.
Room No: N4-B1c-17b
